Marching squares outlines blobs of non-transparent pixels inside a bitmap.


Usage:

```lua
local MarchingSquares = require("MarchingSquares")
 local data  = {
 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 }
local columns = 14
local rows = 14
local results = MarchingSquares.getBlobOutlinePoints(data,columns,rows)

```
result:
```lua
{
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
